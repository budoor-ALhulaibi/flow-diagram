CASE :
Guided Project Pre-Reading
Imagine you recently started working as a business analyst at Tommy's Treadmills, a company that sells equipment for gyms. Your boss asked you to take a closer look at the company's lead process and identity any inefficiencies prior to lead conversion. After you interview some stakeholders, you discover the following information.

In the current process, after a lead (a potential customer) fills out an interest form, Tommy's Treadmills either creates a new lead or updates existing information. An SDR (sales development representative) is then notified that there is a new lead. The SDR follows up with the customer and determines if the company can fulfill the client's needs at an agreeable price. If the SDR qualifies the lead (determines that the potential customer has a genuine need for the product and is in a position to make a purchase), it becomes a "prospect" and is converted to an opportunity, account, and contact within Tommy's Treadmills. If not, the lead is marked "cold" and is placed on a follow-up email list.

 so next, you will build out the company's process.
